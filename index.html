        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="assets/photo.jpg" alt="Tiago's Photo" class="profile-photo">
        <p>Hello, my name is Tiago, a 21-year-old Computer Engineering student who's found his calling in the intricate world of technology. I am in my third year of minor studies, yet, every day I'm learning, challenging myself, striving to transform complexity into simplicity. The energy that lights me up from within comes from my relentless pursuit of knowledge and my determination to never back down, regardless of the obstacles that stand in my path.</p>
        <p>When it comes to my work, I maintain a focused and disciplined approach. I view each challenge as an opportunity for learning and personal growth, seeing every problem as a puzzle that can deepen my understanding. I continuously strive for improvement, believing in the power of effort and persistence. I may not be breaking boundaries or creating new paths, but I ensure a constant pursuit of knowledge and betterment â€“ it's this ethos that truly defines my character.</p>
        <p>Yet, my life isn't solely dedicated to the realms of academia and technology. I actively seek to involve myself in activities outside of my studies, like volunteer work, event organization, and participation in the student's union. I believe in the power of community, in giving back, and in creating spaces for others to grow, learn, and succeed.</p>
        <p>Through these endeavors, I've discovered the immense joy and fulfillment that comes from making a difference. It helps me grow as a person, expanding my perspective and enriching my life in ways I could never have imagined.</p>
        <p>In short, I'm a young man who is not just forging a path in the world of technology but is also committed to making a difference in the world around me.</p>
