        <img src="assets/photo.jpeg" alt="Tiago's Photo" class="profile-photo">
        <p>Hello, my name is Tiago, a 21-year-old Computer Engineering student with a passion for technology. In my third year of minor studies, I constantly challenge myself to simplify complexity and pursue knowledge relentlessly. My disciplined approach to work turns challenges into opportunities for growth and learning.</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I engage in volunteer work, event organization, and participate in the student union. I believe in the power of community and the joy of making a difference. These experiences enrich my perspective and personal growth.</p>
        <p>I am dedicated not only to advancing in technology but also to positively impacting the world around me.</p>
